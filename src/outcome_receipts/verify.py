"""Re-derivation check for a committed receipts manifest.

A receipt is only worth trusting if it can be re-derived. ``receipts verify``
recomputes every figure from the report spec and the cited data, then checks each
recomputed value, slice hash, row count, query, and display against the receipts
manifest the report was exported with. A mismatch is drift: the data changed, the
spec changed, or the manifest was edited after the fact. Verify fails closed,
reporting every drifted receipt and any receipt it cannot re-derive, so a silent
divergence cannot pass.

The timestamp is deliberately not checked. ``computed_at`` records when a figure
was produced, so it differs run to run by design; comparing it would flag every
re-run as drift and say nothing about whether the numbers still hold.

    exported before the policy existed, so its report proves nothing about the
    policy in force. A manifest carrying approvals against a spec that declares
    none records a gate nothing now defines.
