class MetricSpec:
    """How to compute one figure, deterministically.

    ``value_sql`` is a query returning a single scalar (the figure's value).
    ``slice_sql`` returns the rows the figure is computed over; it is used for the
    row count and the slice hash, the evidence that the value came from a specific
    set of records. ``unit`` selects formatting: ``count``, ``percent``, ``money``
    (a ``$``-prefixed amount), ``duration`` (a number of ``days``), or ``rate`` (a
    bare fixed-decimal number). ``decimals`` sets the fixed-decimal places; ``money``
    typically uses 2. Each unit has one canonical display form (see ADR 0004), the
    single string the grounding gate binds.

    ``description`` is a short label. ``definition`` is the precise, plain-language
    statement of what the figure counts: the time window, who is in scope, and the
    deduplication rule. The definition rides in the receipt and renders next to the
    figure, so a reviewer can see and contest the choices a query encodes (a count
    of "clients served" is only as fair as its definition) instead of inferring
    them from the SQL.

    ``kind`` distinguishes an ``output`` (an activity count, such as clients
    served) from an ``outcome`` (a change in condition, such as a housing-retention
    rate). It rides in the receipt so a reader does not misread a busy output as
    the outcome it is meant to produce.

    ``indicator``, ``data_source``, and ``collection_frequency`` are the optional
    logic-model mapping. They tie the figure to a row in a theory of change: the
    named indicator it measures, the system the data comes from, and how often that
    data is collected. Each defaults to empty, which means the figure is not mapped;
    when set they ride into the receipt so the mapping travels with the number.

    ``caveat`` is an optional qualifying note (e.g. a data-quality limitation)
    that travels with the receipt, so a limitation on the figure rides inside the
    receipt chain and renders next to the figure instead of living as loose prose.

    ``requirement_id`` names the requirement in the bound requirement document
    that this metric answers. It is empty for a metric that answers no declared
    requirement, and it is the only link between a funder's requirement set and

    (``outcome``), so a reader of the receipt alone does not misread an output as
    an outcome. ``indicator``, ``data_source``, and ``collection_frequency`` carry

    carries ``suppressed=False`` with ``value=0.0``, ``row_count=0``, and the
