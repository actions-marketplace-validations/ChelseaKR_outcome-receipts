"""A read-only Model Context Protocol server over standard input and output.

The load-bearing invariant of this project is that numbers never come from a
model. The Bedrock drafter is one integration, but organizations draft in
whatever assistant they already have, and the risk is identical everywhere: a
fluent number nobody checked. This server puts the gate where the drafting
happens, so any assistant can check a draft against the publishable figures
before a human ever reads it.

What it is
----------
JSON-RPC 2.0, one message per line, on stdin and stdout. No socket, no port, no
network of its own, and no dependency: the transport is newline-delimited JSON
over two file objects, which the standard library already provides, so the
default install gains this command without gaining a package. That keeps the
"zero runtime dependencies" property the README states, which an optional extra
would have qualified.

What it deliberately is not
---------------------------
Read-only, and structurally so rather than by intention. ``TOOLS`` is the whole
surface; a name outside it is refused before any handler runs, and there is no
handler that writes a file, exports a report, or records an approval. ``run``
with human sign-off remains the only path to an export, and nothing here can
stand in for it.

Every tool answers from the **publishable** figure set -- what ``run`` would
export, after suppression -- so a withheld cell comes back as the redaction
marker with a null value, never as the number it hides. The pre-suppression
figures are reachable in exactly one place, ``audit_narrative``, and only as the
*classifier* that lets a disclosed span be named as a disclosure; no display or
value from that set is ever put in a response. The distinction matters: a
disclosure response echoes the number the client itself sent, which is not the
server disclosing anything, while a figure listing that carried a raw withheld
value would be.

Nothing narrative is logged. A tool's arguments carry the author's draft, so the
error path names the tool and the exception type and nothing else; there is no
log level that turns the text back on.
