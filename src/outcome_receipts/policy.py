"""The registry of named small-cell suppression policies.

The threshold this tool ships is a policy choice with a primary source, not a
constant of nature, and the README already says the binding rule is the
operator's. A named policy makes that choice explicit, citable, and pinnable
from a spec, so a receipt can say *which* rule produced a withheld cell rather
than only that something was withheld.

**Why the registry has exactly one entry.**

`docs/audits/hud-coc-suppression-calibration-2026-08-21.md` established, against
real published HUD data, that HUD prescribes no numeric small-cell rule at all:
its own CoC-level Point-in-Time reports are published unsuppressed, down to and
including exact zeros, and its HMIS standards leave the numeric rule to local
policy. So there is no second *cited* policy to register. Inventing a
`hud-...` entry with a citation would fabricate a source, which is precisely
what this module exists to prevent.

An operator who wants to see the consequences of a different number therefore
supplies it directly, and gets an `ad_hoc_policy` that is labeled uncited and
carries no citation. That distinction is the point: a preview may explore any
threshold, but only a registered policy claims a source.
