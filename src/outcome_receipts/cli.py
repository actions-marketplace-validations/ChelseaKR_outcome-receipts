"""Command-line interface.

Commands:
  map     map logical funder requirements to schema-variant CSV columns and emit
          a fail-closed human review queue (never executes a candidate)
  init    inspect an export and scaffold a starter TOML metric spec (empty stubs
          that fail loudly until a human fills in the SQL and definitions)
  run     compute figures, draft the narrative, run the grounding gate, and write
          the report, receipts manifest, and trace view (export blocked if any
          number is unbound)
  audit   run the grounding gate over an existing narrative file, against the
          figures the report may publish, and report both unbound numbers and
          numbers that state a cell small-cell suppression withholds
  mcp     serve audit, verify, trace, and the publishable figure list to a
          drafting tool over stdio, read-only (no export, no network)
  verify  re-derive every receipt in a manifest from the spec and data, and fail
          on any drift
  verify-ledger
          re-hash the append-only export ledger and fail if the chain is broken
  verify-bundle
          recompute the bundle manifest over an output directory and fail on any
          member that was tampered, is missing, or is extra
  diff    compare two receipts manifests from different reporting cycles and report
          which figures moved, were added, or removed, and why
  restate
          link a current run to a verified prior bundle without rewriting history
  migrate-check
          compare reviewed metrics across two schema-variant exports
  requirements-diff
          classify funder requirement changes by stable identifier
  contract-check
          package receipted milestone, threshold, and financial evidence
  rollup  compose a count from verified, unsuppressed partner bundles
  equity-review
          package allowlisted subgroup receipts after whole-report suppression
  verify-workflow
          validate a versioned evidence-workflow artifact before interpreting it
  eval    score the exported (post-suppression) narrative's grounding and write
          the eval report

Every command exits with a code from the contract below, and ``--json`` makes any
command emit one machine-readable object instead of the human-readable lines. The
exit code is the same either way; the JSON is purely presentational.

argparse only; no runtime dependency beyond the standard library.

    The narratives are *all* of `spec.report.effective_templates`, drafted

    `draft(spec.report, ...)`, which fills only the legacy single

    string, found no numbers, and reported a pass over nothing. That is the shape
    of `examples/multi-funder/report.toml`, which ships here, and whose two
    funder narratives carry real figures eval never looked at.

    A figure written into two funder narratives is counted twice, and that is the
    intended denominator, not an artifact to correct. `run` exports one report
    per format, each a separate document a separate funder reads, so each
