"""Small-cell suppression: privacy-protecting redaction of aggregate counts.

Suppression logic is modeled on the U.S. CMS Cell Size Suppression Policy:
- Aggregate counts in the range [1, 10] (below the threshold of 11) are suppressed.
- True zeros (count = 0) are preserved unencrypted, as they contain no privacy risk.
- Complementary suppression is applied: when a cell is suppressed, other cells in
  the same crosstab are suppressed as needed so the suppressed value cannot be
  recovered by subtraction. For single-dimension tables with no complementary cells,
  the suppressed value alone is redacted.

A suppressed ``Figure`` is redacted at every layer that could leak the raw count:
its own ``value``/``display``, and its ``Receipt``'s ``value``, ``row_count``, and
``slice_hash``. A caller that reads ``figure.receipt.row_count`` (as the report,
manifest, and trace renderers do) must see the same redaction a caller reading
``figure.value`` sees; a suppressed ``Figure`` sharing an unredacted ``Receipt`` is
not suppression, it is a suppressed label glued to an unsuppressed number.

Disclosure scope: the whole report, per unit. An earlier revision scoped the
complementary check to sibling groups (a comparison metric's period and delta
figures together, every headline metric in a separate report-level group), on
the theory that only figures presented together would be combined by a reader.
That partition severed real accounting identities: a whole-period headline is
the sum of its own period figures (``exits_permanent = __q1 + __q2``), so
``headline - q2`` printed a suppressed ``q1`` into the same report, undetected,
because the two figures sat in different groups. The report spec is a flat
metric list over one data table; per-period category sums, category totals, and
headline/period identities all cross any finer grouping the metric ids could
induce, so any partition can sever an identity a reader actually knows. The
rule now: every count figure in a report is checked against every other count
figure, and every percent figure against every other percent figure (counts and
percents are never additive with each other). The cost is that a coincidental
arithmetic match between unrelated figures can suppress more than strictly
necessary; over-suppression is the protective direction, and a leak is a
defect, so the trade is accepted.

Two relationships need rules of their own, because they are not plain +/- sums:

- A comparison delta is defined as current minus prior. When either period
  figure is suppressed, the delta is suppressed with it: a visible delta beside
  the other period reconstructs the hidden period directly, and a visible delta
  beside a visible whole-period headline pins the hidden period at
  ``(headline - delta) / 2`` -- a recovery with a coefficient the signed-sum
  search cannot represent, so it is closed by rule rather than by search.
- A percent is a ratio of counts, and a percent with a visible denominator
  uniquely determines a suppressed numerator via rounding (71% of 14 exits can
  only be 10). ``MetricSpec`` cannot express which count metrics feed a percent
  (``value_sql`` is opaque SQL), so the conservative rule applies: when any
  count figure in the report is suppressed, every percent figure is suppressed
  with it. This is deliberately blunt -- a percent whose numerator and
  denominator are both visible is suppressed too -- because the dependency
  cannot be traced from the data model, and guessing it from SQL text is the
  name-matching heuristic this module already rejected once.

The disclosure boundary is not limited to ``Figure``s. A ``ComparisonRow``'s
``direction`` (and its derived ``arrow``) is a word computed from the sign of
the raw, unredacted delta, not a ``Figure`` with its own value or receipt --
so the exhaustive same-unit search above, which ranges only over ``Figure``
values, cannot see it, redact it, or use it as a candidate. Left alone, it
asserts a real fact about a cell the report declined to publish: "no change"
certifies prior == current *exactly*. ``redact_comparison`` and
``redact_reconciliation`` close this by direct rule rather than by search --
whenever a row's ``prior``, ``current``, or ``delta`` ends up redacted, that
row's ``direction`` is redacted with it, to the same sentinel a redacted
``Figure`` displays. See ``_redact_row_direction``. Any future presentation
field derived from a figure's raw value, rather than carried as a ``Figure``
itself, needs the same treatment: it is inside this boundary by default, not
outside it by omission.

The guarantee, stated precisely: after suppression reaches its fixed point, no
suppressed figure's exact value is certified to a reader by the figures still
visible -- not by any single +/- combination of same-unit visible figures, not
by a delta definition, and not by a percent with a visible input. Two things
are deliberately outside that guarantee. A suppressed value may still be
*consistent* with the visible figures (a headline of 13 with both period
figures hidden tells the reader the two hidden values sum to 13; an interval
is not a disclosure under the cell-suppression model). And a hidden value may
coincidentally equal some arithmetic on visible figures from unrelated metrics
(nothing certifies the coincidence to the reader, who cannot distinguish it
from the other combinations that do not match). What must never happen is the
demonstrated failures: an accounting identity the reader actually holds --
total minus categories, headline minus a period, one period plus a visible
delta, a percent times its visible denominator -- landing exactly on a
suppressed cell.

    "[SUPPRESSED]" label if the receipt is not also redacted. So every field on
    the receipt that carries the raw count is replaced here.

    They are replaced with ``None``, not with zero, and the receipt is stamped

    Runs three rules to a shared fixed point, since applying any one of them can

    1. A suppressed period figure pulls its own delta figure down with it. The
       delta is current minus prior by definition; visible, it reconstructs the
       hidden period from the other period figure or from a whole-period
       headline, and the headline route has a coefficient (a half) the signed
       sum search below cannot represent. See the ``_DELTA_SUFFIX`` note.
    2. Once any count figure is suppressed (primary or complementary), every
       percent figure is suppressed too. A percent with a visible denominator
       uniquely determines a suppressed numerator via rounding, and the data
       model cannot say which counts feed which percent, so the conservative
       rule from the module docstring applies.
    3. For every primary-suppressed figure, the exact-recovery search: can the
       suppressed value be rebuilt by adding or subtracting still-visible
       figures of the same unit anywhere in the report (a total minus its other
       named parts, a headline minus the other period, a sibling category minus
       another)? If a disclosing combination exists, the smallest-valued figure
       in it is suppressed -- the standard "next-smallest cell" rule, the least
       additional information that breaks that recovery -- and the loop repeats,
       since one redaction can leave another combination that discloses the same
       or a different suppressed cell.

    The disclosure scope is the whole report, split only by unit (counts check
    against counts, percents against percents); see the module docstring for why
    any finer grouping severed real accounting identities. A comparison delta
    figure is never a *target* of rule 3 (its recoverability from its own
    periods is definitional, not a discovered disclosure), but it is a candidate

    redacted state, the direction is too, using the exact sentinel a redacted
    ``Figure`` displays, so a row never shows three ``[SUPPRESSED]`` cells beside
    a still-informative word. A row with nothing suppressed keeps its real,
