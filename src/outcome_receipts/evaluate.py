"""Eval scoring.

Correctness here is asymmetric, like the sibling project's. A number in a funder
report that is wrong or invented is the expensive, sometimes reputation-ending
error; a number that is correct but phrased awkwardly is not. So the gated metric
is the grounding rate: the share of numbers in the narrative that bind to a
receipt. It must be 100%, fail-closed, before a report can be exported. The
hallucinated-number rate (the complement) is reported with a Wilson confidence
interval because the denominator is small.
