"""Charts drawn from grounded figures, with an accessible data table.

A chart here has no data of its own. Its bars or points are the values of figures
that were already computed by a deterministic query and already carry a receipt.
The chart reads ``figure.value`` for geometry and ``figure.display`` for every
label, so there is no second, ungrounded path to a number on the page.

Two surfaces come out of one chart. The SVG is the visual rendering; its only
numbers are pixel coordinates derived from the grounded values, and those
coordinates are presentation, not claims, so they are kept out of the report's
prose and out of the grounding gate. The accessible data table is the text
equivalent: it carries the actual figures as their display strings, and those
are grounded exactly like any number in the narrative. The SVG is written beside
the report and referenced as an image; the data table is inlined as its
alternative, so a screen-reader user reads the same grounded numbers a sighted
reader sees in the bars.

A bar height is a claim. So is the slope of a line. A figure withheld by
small-cell suppression has no value to draw, and drawing it as zero made the
picture assert what the same page refuses to assert in text: an empty bar on the
axis baseline, and a polyline dropping to the floor and recovering, inventing a
collapse across data that was withheld on purpose. A withheld point is therefore
drawn as an explicit absence:

- a bar becomes a full-height hatched slot with a dashed outline in the muted
  gray used for the axis, never the data color, labeled with the same
  ``[SUPPRESSED]`` marker the rest of the report uses;
- a line breaks. The polyline is emitted once per run of consecutive drawable
  points, so no segment spans a withheld one, and the withheld position gets a
  dashed vertical rule rather than a plotted point;
- withheld figures are excluded from the axis scale, so they cannot flatten the
  points that are drawn by pretending to be zeros.

The absence is announced, not only drawn: the marker carries a ``<title>``, the
chart's ``<desc>`` names how many points are withheld, and the accessible data
table already carries ``[SUPPRESSED]`` as text.

A negative value is refused rather than drawn. A comparison or reconciliation
delta figure carries the *signed* change in ``Figure.value``, and nothing stops
a ``[[charts]]`` block from naming one, so a metric that decreased arrived here
as a real, fully receipted, negative number. Both drawing paths assumed
non-negative: a bar took the ``else`` branch and rendered ``height="0.0"``,
flush on the baseline with its own label reading ``12`` above it, and a line
plotted at ``y=668`` on a canvas 360 high, off the image entirely. The bar
claimed "no change" where the receipt said minus twelve.

Drawing the magnitude instead is not the fix, and it is a worse version of the
same fault: it makes a decrease of 12 and an increase of 12 produce identical
geometry and an identical ``<title>``, so the decrease becomes the tallest bar
on the chart with nothing marking it. A signed bar from a zero baseline would be
honest geometry, but this module could not label it. The only text a chart may
put on the page is ``figure.display``, so that the grounding gate verifies a
chart exactly as it verifies prose, and a delta figure's display is its
*unsigned magnitude* by design (``comparison._magnitude_display``), with the
direction carried as a word on ``ComparisonRow``, which a chart never receives.
Signed geometry with no signed text equivalent would leave a screen-reader user
reading the same "12" for a rise and a fall. So ``_points`` raises, naming the
chart, the metric, and the value, and the report fails to build rather than
building a picture that is wrong. Zero is unaffected: a true zero is a real
value and still draws a zero-height bar on the baseline.

Pure standard library: the SVG is assembled as text, so the project keeps its
zero-dependency, offline posture.
