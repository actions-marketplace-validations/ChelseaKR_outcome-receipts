"""A batch of report specs, and the single page an auditor enters through.

An organization does not publish one report. It publishes a grant report, a
board report, and a template per funder, each from its own spec, each run
separately. The receipts prove every figure in each one; nothing proves anything
about the set. An auditor holding five output directories has no page saying
which reports exist, which still verify, who signed each one off, and whether
two of them state the same metric differently.

``receipts portfolio`` runs each spec through the ordinary export path with no
shortcuts -- the same grounding gate, the same coverage refusal, the same human
approval -- and records what it wrote in ``portfolio.json``. ``receipts
portfolio-verify`` re-verifies every bundle from its own spec and renders
``index.html`` over the result.

The index computes no figure. Every number on it was already receipted by the
run that produced it, and the shared-figure table compares receipts rather than
recomputing them. Where two reports state the same metric id, the comparison has
four outcomes and they are kept distinct: the reports agree, their definitions
differ (so their values are not comparable at all), one report withheld the cell
under suppression (an absence, never a disagreement and never a zero), or the
definitions match and the values do not, which is the only one of the four that
means the reports contradict each other.
