"""Deterministic evidence workflows built on verified aggregate receipts.

These workflows extend the report trust chain without creating a second source of
program numbers. Row-backed figures are computed by the metric engine. Derived
figures, such as a restatement delta or partner rollup, are computed by SQLite
over verified receipt values and are labeled ``receipt_composed`` so they cannot
be mistaken for row-backed receipts.

Every builder is pure with respect to its output: it validates all inputs and
returns a complete JSON-compatible artifact, or raises :class:`WorkflowError`.
The CLI writes the artifact only after the builder succeeds, preserving the
project's fail-closed rule.

    A slice hash is a content hash of the exact rows a figure was computed from,
    so two partner receipts carrying the same non-empty slice hash counted the
    same people. Summing both double counts them, and the plan declared the
    populations disjoint, so the declaration is contradicted by evidence the
    partners already published. The lead agency reaches that conclusion without
    ever holding a client row: the hashes are enough.

    This is the one duplicate-client case the tool can decide on its own. Every
    other overlap stays what the plan says it is, an operator declaration, so a
    plan labeled ``not_deduplicated`` is left alone: it has already told the
    reader the combined figure counts some people more than once.

    The exemption for an empty slice is keyed on what the receipt reports, not on
    the hash. A slice with zero rows hashes to ``EMPTY_SLICE_HASH`` no matter
    whose data produced it, so two partners both reporting a true zero are not a
    collision. But that sentinel is also what a receipt carries when its value was
    computed over rows its slice query does not return, and such a receipt would
    otherwise skip the gate while contributing a non-zero count to the sum: the
    hash it publishes cannot be compared with any other partner's. A receipt that
    reports a non-zero count over an empty slice is therefore refused rather than
    exempted. See ``docs/adr/0004-fail-closed-disjoint-rollup-slice-check.md``.

    ``slice_hash``, ``value``, and ``row_count`` are required, not defaulted. This
    function runs only after the caller already rejected an explicitly withheld
    receipt (``_is_suppressed``), so a receipt reaching here that is still missing
    one of these fields is malformed or foreign, not suppressed. The old code
    defaulted a missing field to ``""``/``0.0``/``0``, which is exactly the shape
    of a genuine empty-slice zero -- so a receipt with, say, no ``slice_hash`` key
    at all sailed through as "verified empty" and was silently exempted from the
    one duplicate-client check this function exists to run, while its count still
    entered the rollup sum.
