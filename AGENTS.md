## What this is

`outcome-receipts` drafts a funder outcome report in which **every reported
figure is a receipt**. It connects to a nonprofit's own service data, computes each required
figure with a deterministic query, and attaches to that figure a receipt: the
exact query, the row count, a content hash of the data slice it was computed
from, and a timestamp. A drafting step writes narrative prose around the
receipted figures. A fail-closed grounding gate then strips or flags any number
in the prose that does not trace to a receipt, before a human approves each
figure and exports the report.

The contribution is not a new verification primitive (those are published) and
not a new reporting product (commercial ones exist). It is the open-source,
offline-first chain — compute-with-receipt, draft, fail-closed grounding audit,
human approval, provenance-stamped export — with a privacy posture (small-cell
suppression, aggregate-only output) a human-services org can defend to its
clients and its funder at the same time.

## Why it exists (strategic context — read this, it shapes decisions)

This is a portfolio and contribution project by Chelsea Kelly-Reif. It is the
second pillar of a nonprofit-data pair: `constituent-reconciler` gets messy
intake *into* the system of record; `outcome-receipts` gets verified outcome
numbers *out* of it and into a funder report. Build it so the two read as
siblings: same engineering bar, same fail-closed instinct, same honesty about
what is solved art versus what is the actual contribution.

The research that motivated it found three things. Funders are beginning to
reject reports that are "substantially AI-developed," because an LLM that writes
plausible outcome numbers is a liability, not a help. The per-figure
verify-or-flag idea is already published (Proof-Carrying Numbers, VeriTrail) and
a commercial tool (Sopact) already markets deterministic record-cited reporting,
so **do not claim a new primitive**. The genuinely hard, genuinely unserved part
is metric-mapping over schema-variant exports: turning "unduplicated clients
exiting to permanent housing" into a correct deterministic query over one
specific org's messy HMIS or CSV export. That mapping, plus the receipts and the
fail-closed grounding gate, is where the work is.

Two audiences:

1. **Grant and program staff** at small-to-mid human-services nonprofits who
   assemble outcome reports by hand each cycle, copying numbers between a case
   system, a spreadsheet, and a funder template, and who cannot afford a wrong
   number in front of a funder.
2. **The nonprofit-tech and responsible-AI community** who will judge the repo
   as a work sample and as a reference for "how to put an LLM near reporting
   without letting it invent the figures."

Do not frame this repo anywhere in its docs as a job-search artifact. The README
speaks only to nonprofit practitioners.

## Ground rules for Codex

* **Numbers never come from the model. Ever.** Every figure in a report is
  computed by a deterministic query over the org's data and carries a receipt.
  The LLM drafts prose *around* already-computed, already-receipted figures. A
  number that originates in the model is a defect, and the grounding gate exists
  to catch it. This is the single load-bearing invariant; it is a merge-blocking
  test (`tests/test_grounding_gate.py`).
* **Fail closed, everywhere.** A figure with no receipt, a query that errors, a
  metric the mapper is unsure about, a cell too small to publish safely, a
  consent or suppression rule that is ambiguous: all route to a human or block
  the export. Never silent-pass, never publish an unverifiable number.
* **The grounding gate is the product.** Given a drafted narrative and the set
  of receipts, every numeric span in the narrative must bind to a receipt whose
  value matches. Unbound or mismatched numbers are stripped and surfaced for
  review. A report cannot be exported while any numeric span is unbound.
* **Small-cell suppression is a privacy invariant, not a setting.** Aggregate
  outcome counts below the controlling threshold are suppressed in every export,
  and complementary suppression is applied so a suppressed cell cannot be
  recovered by subtraction. The CMS-modeled default suppresses 1 through 10;
  HUD leaves the numeric rule to the applicable policy. This is merge-blocked by
  `tests/test_suppression.py`. Do not invent a report-specific threshold or
  complementary rule; cite the controlling source.
* **Aggregate-only by default.** A report is aggregate statistics, not a client
  roster. The export path emits counts, rates, and the narrative; it never emits
  client-level rows. Emitting a client identifier in a report is a defect.
* **Deterministic by default; the LLM is an optional seam.** Metric computation,
  receipt generation, the grounding gate, and suppression all run with zero
  cloud calls. The drafting seam (Codex on Bedrock) writes narrative only, and
  only when enabled. v0.1 ships the entire receipted-figure path with no LLM at
  all, so the differentiator is provable before any model is wired in.
* **Be honest about novelty.** The README says plainly: the verify-or-flag
  primitive is published, deterministic record-cited reporting is sold
  commercially, and the contribution is the open chain plus the metric-mapping
  plus the privacy posture. No "first-ever," no "new primitive."
* **Never invent compliance or statistical-disclosure facts.** Suppression
  thresholds, complementary-suppression rules, and any funder-specific
  definition come from primary sources (HUD HMIS reporting guidance, the
  funder's own data dictionary), read at build time, not from memory. Where a
  rule is ambiguous, implement the more protective interpretation and record the
  question.
* Python 3.12+. Keep the dependency surface small. The metric engine runs on
  the standard library plus a dataframe/SQL layer (DuckDB is the likely choice;
  record the decision in an ADR). `tomllib` for specs, `argparse` for the CLI.
  The LLM client appears only inside the drafting seam, nowhere else. License:
  Apache-2.0, matching the portfolio default.

## Conformance to the portfolio STANDARDS

This repo holds itself to the portfolio's shared engineering standards. Per the
"reference, don't repeat" rule, the rigor is defined once in the STANDARDS set;
this repo records only its own values and findings (in README, `docs/ROADMAP.md`
metrics ledger, and `docs/RESPONSIBLE-TECH-AUDITS.md`). The concrete bars this
repo commits to:

* **Code quality.** `ruff` (full select set: `E,W,F,I,UP,B,SIM,S,C90,RUF`,
  `max-complexity = 10`), `mypy --strict`, `pytest` with branch coverage
  **≥ 90%** (treat the metric engine as a library; correctness is the product),
  all merge-blocking. `uv` with a committed `uv.lock`; `uv sync --locked` in CI.
  PyPA src layout, `pyproject.toml` as the single config root.
* **AI evaluation.** This is an AI repo: the drafting seam puts a model in the
  path, so the AI-Evaluation standard applies in full. Committed eval on seeded
  synthetic fixtures with planted ground truth. The gated metrics: a
  **fail-closed grounding rate** (zero unbound numeric spans may survive to an
  exported report), a hallucinated-number rate reported with Wilson confidence
  intervals, and judge calibration (Cohen's kappa **≥ 0.60**, recalibrated
  within 30 days) if an LLM judge scores narrative faithfulness. No
  cherry-picking; failures are shown. Model card and data card committed and
  regenerated on release.
* **Security and supply chain.** OWASP ASVS-aligned. SHA-pinned Actions,
  least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`contents: read` default), `pip-audit` and
  secret scanning with no `|| true`. SBOM (CycloneDX) and Sigstore-signed,
  SLSA-provenanced releases via OIDC Trusted Publishing as the release path
  lands.
* **CI/CD.** `make verify` reproduces the full AUTO-GATE set byte-for-byte with
  CI. `main` is protected by an active ruleset whose `bypass_actors` holds
  exactly the repository owner's standing bypass (`RepositoryRole` 5,
  `bypass_mode: always`), deliberately and permanently: an agent once applied
  a ruleset with no bypass and locked the owner out of their own repository,
  and restoring access took a sweep across eighteen repositories. An empty
  list there is not a stricter gate, it is the lockout, so never "restore"
  one. See `docs/rulesets/README.md`.
* **Documentation.** README with a Standards Conformance table (every standard
  marked Applies or N/A-with-reason). MADR-format ADRs in `docs/decisions/`.
  Keep a Changelog. `CITATION.cff`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
* **Accessibility.** N/A for the CLI core (headless, no HTML). When the review
  surface gains an HTML view, WCAG 2.2 AA applies to it.
* **Internationalization.** Report output and any reviewer-facing copy are
  externalized; EN and ES at parity for public-facing strings.
* **Responsible tech.** `docs/RESPONSIBLE-TECH-AUDITS.md` carries all six audits
  (ethics, bias, privacy/DPIA, transparency, accessibility, security) as
  committed findings. Privacy gets a DPIA: the tool reads client-level data to
  compute aggregates, so the data-minimization and suppression posture is the
  central finding.

Project-specific values live in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (metrics ledger) and
`docs/RESPONSIBLE-TECH-AUDITS.md`, never restated from the shared standard. When
publishing as a standalone public repo, keep it self-contained: do not add
relative links to the private STANDARDS repo; state the bar inline as above.

```

Decisions made now so they are not relitigated:

* **A Receipt is the unit of trust.** `Receipt = {metric_id, query, row_count,
  slice_hash, value, unit, computed_at}`. The `slice_hash` is a BLAKE2b hash of
  the canonicalized rows the figure was computed from, so the same data
  reproduces the same receipt and a changed slice is detectable. Receipts are
  immutable values.
* **The metric engine is deterministic and pure.** A `MetricSpec` is a query or
  expression plus a unit and a suppression rule. Running it over a dataset
  returns a `Figure` (a value plus its receipt). No randomness, no model, no
  network. The same data and spec always produce the same figure and receipt.
* **The grounding gate operates on spans, not vibes.** It parses numeric spans
  out of the drafted narrative and binds each to a receipt by value and metric.
  Unbound or value-mismatched spans block export. It is mechanical and testable;
  it does not ask a model whether the narrative "looks faithful."
* **The drafting seam writes words, never numbers.** Its prompt is given the
  receipted figures and instructed to write prose that references them; the
  grounding gate is the enforcement that it complied. Under any policy pack that
  forbids cloud calls, the seam is fused off and the deterministic template
  drafter is used.
* **Suppression runs before export, after grounding.** Order: compute → receipt
  → draft → ground → suppress → human-approve → export. Suppression is the last
  transform before a human sees the report, so what they approve is what ships.
* **Requirement coverage is the other half of the claim, and it gates export.**
  Grounding asks whether every number in the prose traces to a receipt;
  coverage asks whether every number the funder required was published. A spec
  that binds `[requirements]` must account for every requirement as `answered`,
  `withheld`, or `unanswerable`, or `run` refuses on exit code 4 and writes
  nothing. An `unanswerable` declaration carries both a blocker `mapping`
  actually reproduces and a reason a person wrote, because a blocker alone is a
  tool's excuse and a reason alone is unfalsifiable. A spec with no binding
  behaves in every byte as it did before. See ADR 0013.

## Build plan

The sequence below is the historical delivery order. The repository-side work
through the v1 implementation package is complete; release evidence and
post-roadmap use cases are tracked in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and
`docs/NOVEL-USE-CASES.md`.

* **v0.1 — Receipts, no LLM.** Service-data CSV in, a TOML metric spec, the
  deterministic engine, receipts, the deterministic template drafter, and the
  grounding gate. Committed eval with planted figures and planted bad numbers
  showing the gate catches every unbound span. Ships the differentiator with no
  model risk.
* **v0.2 — Small-cell suppression.** The privacy invariant: threshold +
  complementary suppression, sourced from primary HUD guidance, expressed as
  tests. Aggregate-only export hardening.
* **v0.3 — The drafting seam.** Optional Bedrock narrative drafting, policy
  gated. The grounding gate now guards a model's output. Judge calibration with
  Cohen's kappa if an LLM scores faithfulness. Model and data cards.
* **v0.4 — The metric-mapping agent.** Map a funder template's required metrics
  to `MetricSpec`s over a schema-variant export, with a review queue for
  low-confidence mappings. This is the hard, unserved part; it comes after the
  trust machinery is proven.
* **v0.5 — Provenance manifest + verify.** Each exported report carries a
  manifest of its receipts and slice hashes; `receipts verify` re-checks that the
  figures still compute from the cited data. Reuses the portfolio hash-chain
  pattern.
* **v1 implementation package.** Multi-funder output, digest-pinned Docker
  self-hosting, committed audits, and versioned report-spec/manifest contracts
  are implemented. A v1 tag still requires real-organization, cross-release, and
  manual assistive-technology evidence.

## Quality bar

* Every step has a passing and a failing fixture. The privacy-and-trust
  invariants ride on merge-blocking grounding, suppression, model-drafting,
  bundle, schema, and artifact-boundary tests.
* `ruff check`, `mypy --strict`, and `pytest` (branch coverage ≥ 90%) pass in CI
  before any feature work continues. No skipped tests on `main`. No bare
  `# type: ignore` or `# noqa` without an issue reference.
* The eval report is committed and regenerated on release, with the grounding
  rate (fail-closed), the hallucinated-number rate with Wilson CIs, and judge
  calibration if used. Failures are shown, not hidden.
* Conformance to the STANDARDS is declared in the README table, values in
  `docs/ROADMAP.md`, findings in `docs/RESPONSIBLE-TECH-AUDITS.md`.
* Conventional commits; PR-sized changes even when working solo; MADR ADRs for
  every architectural decision (engine backend, receipt hash construction,
  suppression threshold source, the drafting-seam boundary).

## Writing style for docs and messages

Plain, concrete prose. At most one em dash per document, prefer zero. No
rule-of-three rhetorical constructions. No "simply," "just," "powerful,"
"seamless." Vary paragraph openings. A finding or a reviewer-facing label says
what is true, where, and what the reviewer should do, in language a grant
manager can act on. Write like a careful engineer, not a launch tweet.

## Resolved early questions

1. The engine uses stdlib `sqlite3`; ADR 0001 records why the zero-runtime-
   dependency path won and when a larger backend may be reconsidered.
2. The default suppresses CMS-modeled cells 1 through 10 with complementary,
   delta, and percentage recovery controls. HUD leaves the numeric rule to the
   controlling policy, so operators must confirm that policy per report.
3. ADR 0007 requires exact normalized numeric matching, checks range endpoints,
   canonicalizes supported locale decoration, and fails written-out numbers
   closed.
4. The versioned TOML spec stays bounded to report metrics and explicit
   templates. HMIS aliases produce review-required mapping candidates; the tool
   does not become a reporting product.
5. Approval and mapping review use the CLI first. The trace is static accessible
   HTML for recipients; there is no local web application or network ingress.
