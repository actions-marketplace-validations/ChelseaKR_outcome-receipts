# full local gate (AGENTS.md: "keep it self-contained ... state the bar
# inline"). This has to stay a literal for that reason, but it is no longer
# the *only* copy of the list -- when a pinned standards checkout is present
# (`--standards-dir`, wired into the "portfolio standards" CI job), that
# checkout's own controls.yml is the source of truth instead, and this
# literal is checked against it below rather than trusted blindly (see
# `test_fallback_standards_literal_matches_a_pinned_checkout` in
# tests/test_conformance.py). That is what closes the gap DOC-11 named: a
# check that only ever compares the README against its own hardcoded
# expectations reports green even when both have drifted from the real,
# 15-standard portfolio index.

# Each display name is a controls.yml standard `title` with a trailing
# " Standard" suffix stripped (see `_display_name`); the Responsible-Tech

    the real, currently-pinned portfolio index.

    Two distinct absence cases, handled differently on purpose:

    * `standards_dir` itself does not exist: raises `StandardsIndexError`.
      This means the checkout step that was supposed to populate it did not
      run or did not succeed -- a clear, loud failure, never a silent
      fallback, because there is no way to tell whether the fallback list is
      still accurate.
    * `standards_dir` exists but has no `controls.yml`: this is the state of
      this repository's own pin as of 2026-08-21 -- `.standards-version` is
      `v1.0.1`, and `controls.yml` was not added to the standards repo until
      FIX-01 (2026-07-11), well after that tag. The checkout is real and
      trustworthy; it is simply older than the registry this function reads.
      Failing the build over a pin-staleness gap that issue 98 did not ask
      this change to fix, and that a solo maintainer cannot resolve from
      inside this repository, would make "portfolio standards conformance"
      permanently red for a reason unrelated to what it is checking. This

# The AI-Development Measurement standard asks each repository for two things a
# document can hold and a check can read: one scope-declaration line in the
# ROADMAP metrics ledger, and a graduation date on every metric parked in the
# BASELINE state. A BASELINE row with no date is a metric nobody has committed to
# ever decide about, which the standard calls a conformance failure for the same
# reason an aspirational row is one.
#
# Both halves of the date rule are load-bearing, and getting either wrong turns
# this into the shape of check it exists to catch. The date is read out of the
# BASELINE cell alone, not out of the row, because every row in this ledger also
# carries a measurement date: a row-wide search reports a graduation date on a
# row that names none. And the date is compared against today, because a check
# that only asks whether a date is *present* goes permanently green on the day
# after the one it printed -- the metric parked in BASELINE forever, which is
# exactly the state the failure message below says must not be possible.
