"""Check that everything in the tree that carries a version number agrees.

`tests/test_version.py` opens by saying the version is single-sourced from
package metadata "so a tagged release cannot ship a wheel, a CLI, and a tag
that disagree." It proves the first two: `outcome_receipts.__version__` is the
installed distribution's version, and `receipts --version` prints that. **The
tag is the one term in that sentence nothing compared against anything.**

That gap was live on 2026-09-07. `CHANGELOG.md` carried a dated
`## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-07` section, a signed `v0.2.1` tag existed, and
`pyproject.toml` still read `version = "0.2.0"` — the release-prep commit for
`v0.2.0` (`b8f5a27`) had moved the CHANGELOG *and* bumped every place carrying
the version together, and the promotion to `0.2.1` did only the first half.
Nothing was red. `make verify` passed, `ci` passed, and `release.yml`'s
`verify` job had one version check in it -- that `CHANGELOG.md` contains a
section for the tag -- which that tree satisfied.

What a `v0.2.1` dispatch would then have done is worth stating exactly,
because none of it fails early:

* `build` runs `uv build`, which reads `pyproject.toml`, and produces
  `outcome_receipts-0.2.0-*.whl`;
* Sigstore attests those bytes, and the GitHub release for `v0.2.1` is
  published carrying a `0.2.0` wheel;
* `pypi-publish` uploads it, and PyPI accepts it as version `0.2.0` -- a first
  upload, since PyPI has never seen `0.2.0`, so nothing rejects it;
* only then does `verify-published` run
  `uvx --from "outcome-receipts==0.2.1" receipts --help` and fail, on a version
  the index does not have and now never will, because the filename it did get
  is spent.

The gate that would have caught it therefore ran after the irreversible step.
This script moves that comparison to before the first one.

The invariant is the one `b8f5a27` followed by hand: **the version
`pyproject.toml` declares is the newest version `CHANGELOG.md` says was
released, `CITATION.cff` says the same, and `CITATION.cff`'s `date-released`
is that section's date.** So a CHANGELOG promotion that forgets the bump fails
here, and a bump that forgets the CHANGELOG fails here too.

Three outcomes, not two. A file that cannot be parsed for a version -- no
`project.version`, no dated CHANGELOG section, a `## [0.2.1] - not-a-date`
heading -- is **unmeasurable**, and unmeasurable fails. A check of this shape
that shrugged at a missing value would report agreement between two numbers it
never read.

`--tag vX.Y.Z` adds the release-time comparison: the tag being published must
name the version the tree declares. `release.yml` passes it; `make hygiene`
does not, because there is no tag at that point.

Reads the repository by default; `--root` exists so tests/test_release_version.py
drives the identical code path over fixtures.
