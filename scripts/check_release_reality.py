"""Follow a release all the way from the changelog to the index, and say where it stopped.

`v0.2.0` was cut on 2026-08-16 as a signed GitHub release with its full
attested asset set, and it is not on PyPI. The run that cut it did not fail:
`authorize`, `verify`, `build` and `github-release` all succeeded, then
`pypi-publish` — which declares `environment: pypi`, the one environment in
this portfolio with a real `required_reviewers` rule — sat at *Waiting for
review* for thirteen days and was canceled. `verify-published` was canceled
with it.

That is the shape this script exists for, and issue #173 states it in one
sentence: **the check and the thing it checks shared a failure mode.** A
post-publication verification that only runs when publication succeeded cannot
report that publication did not happen, and a run whose conclusion is
`cancelled` is not `failure`, so nothing alerted. Nine days later the gap was
found by a portfolio-wide sweep rather than by anything in this repository.

So this runs **from outside the release run**, on a schedule, over documents
that are all public. It needs no state, no credential beyond a read token, and
nothing from the run that published.

## Three links, because a release can stop at any of them

Measured across this portfolio on 2026-09-09: **43 repositories have release
or publish CI, 21 have ever published a release, and 22 have the machinery and
have never once produced one.** So *"the workflow exists"* is worth nothing as
a signal, and neither is any single link in the chain:

1. **the changelog names a version → a tag names that version.** A dated
   `## [X.Y.Z]` section is a claim that X.Y.Z was released. Elsewhere in this
   portfolio a `1.5.0` section dated 2026-08-18 has no tag at all, so a pin
   written against it resolves to nothing. A check that reads only the
   changelog passes over that.
2. **a tag → a published GitHub release.** A tag is a ref; it publishes
   nothing on its own. In this repository `release.yml` is dispatch-only, so a
   pushed tag with no dispatch is exactly a release that stopped here.
3. **a published release → the package index.** This is where `v0.2.0`
   stopped.

Each link is reported with both of its numbers, `N of M`, so a link that
examined nothing cannot read like a link that passed.

**Assets are deliberately not part of any verdict.** A published release with
zero assets is not a failed release: two repositories here publish
source-only releases on purpose, and a check that assumed assets would report
both as broken. What is being followed is the version, not the artifact.

## Three outcomes, and the third is the reason for the shape of the code

* **ok** — every link holds. Exit 0, with each link's numbers printed.
* **stalled** — a link does not. Exit 1, naming which link and which version.
* **unmeasurable** — a document did not parse, carried no version list,
  declared a contract this script does not read, or held a tag it could not
  read as a version. Exit 2. An input this script cannot read is never a pass,
  and an empty list is never read as "nothing to report": that is the failure
  this whole repository is about, and a release checker that shrugged at a
  listing it could not read would be committing it in its own release path.

Every document is supplied as a file rather than fetched here. The workflow
fetches them, so a failed fetch fails the step in the fetcher's own words and
with its own status code, and this script stays a pure function of its inputs
that `tests/test_release_reality.py` drives over fixtures.

The index document is the PEP 691 JSON simple API
(`https://pypi.org/simple/<name>/` with
`Accept: application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json`), which carries a `versions`
array under PEP 700. **Not** `https://pypi.org/project/<name>/`, which returns
HTTP 200 with a bot-detection page for an automated caller, and **not**
`/pypi/<name>/json`, whose `info.version` is one number where the question is
about a set.

The changelog is parsed by `check_release_version.changelog_release`, imported
rather than reimplemented: two readers of one file drift, and the other one is
already a merge-blocking gate.
