# Run every make target named on the command line, and report each one's result.
#
# Why this exists. The aggregate gates used to be prerequisite lists, and make
# stops a prerequisite list at the first failure. That is the right behavior
# for a build, where step 4 needs step 3's output, and the wrong behavior for
# a gate set, where the checks are independent: one unfixable dependency
# advisory in the npm accessibility toolchain meant `make verify` aborted at
# `security`, so `cards`, `eval-check` and `compat` never ran at all -- and,
# inside `security` itself, OSV-Scanner, gitleaks, Semgrep and zizmor never ran
# either. Silently, because a red job looks the same whether it ran two gates
# or eleven.
#
# So every gate runs, whatever the gates before it did. That is not the same as
# tolerating failure: each gate prints its own PASS/FAIL, and this script exits
# non-zero if any of them failed. Nothing is suppressed and nothing hides
# behind anything else's result.
