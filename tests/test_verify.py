"""Merge-relevant: a committed receipts manifest must re-derive from the data.

``receipts verify`` recomputes every figure from the spec and the cited data, then
checks each value, slice hash, row count, query, unit, and display against the
manifest. These tests pin the passing case (a freshly written manifest re-derives)
and the failing cases (a tampered value, a receipt with no figure, a figure with no
receipt), since re-derivation is only worth shipping if drift fails closed.
