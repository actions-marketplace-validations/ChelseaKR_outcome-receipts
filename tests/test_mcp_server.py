"""The read-only MCP server: what it exposes, and what it can never say.

Issue 163. The tests are grouped by the four "Done when" bullets plus the two
properties that make putting the gate inside a drafting tool safe at all:

1. There is no write surface. Not "no write surface is documented" -- ``TOOLS``
   is the whole dispatch table, a name outside it never reaches a handler, and
   the key set is pinned here so adding one is a deliberate edit to this file.
2. A withheld cell cannot come back as its value. The sentinel below hands the
   server a withheld figure whose raw display is a token that appears nowhere
   else, then reads every byte of every response looking for it.
