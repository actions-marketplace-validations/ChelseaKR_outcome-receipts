"""Regression tests for the Semgrep waiver ledger cross-check.

`.semgrep-waivers.yml` asserted its own invariant in a header comment and
nothing enforced it. These tests drive `scripts/check_semgrep_waivers.py` over
fixture trees, in both directions: a ledger row with no suppression behind it,
and a suppression with no ledger row in front of it. A gate that only ever ran
against a consistent repository would report green in both of those states,
which is the failure mode this file exists to rule out.

The same question is asked of the ledger's own dates. `last_reviewed` was
validated as an ISO date and then ignored, so the quarterly cadence issues 52
and 53 promise had nothing enforcing it: these drive the clock, not the tree,
and one of them runs the real ledger forward past its own quarter so "the
cadence is enforced" is a claim about the committed document.
