"""Compatibility evidence frozen from the signed v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 releases.

Two halves. The tests that re-derive a released manifest establish that an
artifact this package shipped is still readable by the package as it stands. The
tests that relabel or edit one of those same artifacts establish the other half,
which a passing row alone cannot: that the reader is discriminating. A verifier
that accepts every document accepts a released one too, and its PASS says
nothing. Issue 65 asks for both, recorded together.
