"""The comparative-claim gate.

Two invariants are under test and they fail in opposite directions. The detector must
not miss a direction word, because a missed one is a claim the drafter got to make for
free. The binder must not bind a claim to something that is not a receipted direction,
because that would be the gate manufacturing the very thing it exists to check.

The catalog and the compiled detector are checked against each other, in both
directions, so a phrase added to one and not the other is a failure rather than a
silent hole.
