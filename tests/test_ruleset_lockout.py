"""No committed ruleset file may lock the repository owner out when it is applied.

A ruleset file in this tree is not a description. It is an instrument: `docs/rulesets/`
carries the command that posts one, and `gh api -X POST .../rulesets --input <file>` sends
the file exactly as it stands. GitHub answers 201 whether or not a bypass actor survived.
With none, and with this profile requiring a pull request, six contexts, a strict
up-to-date policy, signed commits and linear history, the sole maintainer cannot merge
past a wedged check, cannot push, and cannot delete the ruleset that is blocking them.
That is not hypothetical: an agent applied a no-bypass ruleset elsewhere in this portfolio
and restoring access took a sweep across eighteen repositories.

Both committed rulesets here carried `"bypass_actors": []`, and the documented apply
command pointed at the staler of the two. Nothing read either file:
`grep -rln 'bypass_actors' tests/ src/ scripts/` returned nothing, so correcting the value
once would have left the regression path open.

Two design choices, both answering a defect this repository actually had.

**Files are discovered, not named.** The stale second ruleset existed for five months
without anything noticing, because a guard written against one hardcoded path is blind to
the file next to it. This module globs, so a ruleset file that reappears anywhere is
covered the day it lands, and finding none at all is a failure rather than a quiet pass.

**The document is parsed, not searched.** A truncated JSON file still contains the literal
string `bypass_actors`, so a grep-based check vouches for a file it cannot read. The parse
is what catches that, and an unparseable or missing file fails here rather than defaulting
to something the assertions would read as "nothing wrong".

`lockout_risk` is a pure function of a parsed document, so it is run against the documents
it must reject as well as against the ones in the tree, with a positive control so it
cannot pass by refusing everything.

What this does not check is whether a committed export still matches the live ruleset.
That needs a network call, which these gates do not make. See `docs/rulesets/README.md`.
