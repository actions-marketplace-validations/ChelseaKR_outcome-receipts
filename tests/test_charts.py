"""Tests for charts drawn from grounded figures.

The load-bearing property is that a chart has no data path of its own: its bars
and points are the figures' values, and every number it renders is a figure
display, so the grounding gate verifies a chart the same way it verifies prose.
These tests pin that, plus the accessible data table and the SVG's image role.
