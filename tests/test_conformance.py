# A frozen, verbatim copy of the 15 standard-registry lines from the portfolio
# standards repo's controls.yml. This is what a real `--standards-dir` checkout
# looks like; the test below proves the vendored FALLBACK_STANDARDS literal
# (used by the self-contained `make verify`) agrees with it.
#
# It is not a snapshot of the version this repository pins, and saying so would
# be worse than saying nothing. `.standards-version` pins v1.0.1, and
# controls.yml did not exist yet at v1.0.1; it arrived with FIX-01 on
# 2026-07-11. So this snapshot is of a later registry than the pin names, and
# the consequence is worth stating where a reader will meet it: the "portfolio
# standards" CI job checks the pinned ref out and runs
# `check_conformance.py --standards-dir .standards` against it, that checkout
# has no controls.yml, and `standards_index` therefore warns and falls back to
# the vendored literal. The job passes in a few seconds having compared the
# README against the same hardcoded list DOC-11 set out to stop trusting.
#
# Nothing is currently checking either copy against a live registry. This test
# compares two copies in this repository, which catches an edit to one of them
# and nothing else, and that is all it can claim. The live cross-check starts
# working when `.standards-version` moves to a version that carries
# controls.yml, which is a deliberate portfolio-pin decision with repository-wide
# scope, recorded in `standards_index`'s own warning text rather than made here.
# `test_the_standards_pin_is_named_the_same_way_in_all_three_places` below keeps
# the pin's three copies from drifting in the meantime.
