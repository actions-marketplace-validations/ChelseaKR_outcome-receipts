"""A batch of specs, and the index an auditor enters the portfolio through.

Two things are being pinned here. The batch runs every spec through the ordinary
export path, so a spec that fails the gate stops it and leaves no record behind;
and the index is composed from what those exports already proved, so a bundle
edited after the batch stops verifying and says which one.

The shared-figure table is where the project's three-state discipline has to
hold across reports rather than within one. A withheld cell is not a
disagreement with a published number, and it is certainly not a zero; two
reports counting different things are not comparable at all. Only two reports
that count the same thing and publish different numbers contradict each other,
and that is the only case the table says so about.
