"""The npm-audit waiver is bounded to one advisory, and provably so.

The gate exists so one reviewed, unpatched advisory can be accepted by name
without lowering the severity floor for everything else. An exception mechanism
nobody has tested is worse than no exception at all, so these pin what it will
*not* accept: a different advisory, a second advisory in the same package, the
waived advisory on another package or at a higher severity, and an expired or
malformed waiver all still fail.

They run against `tests/fixtures/npm-audit/waivers.yml`, not the live registry.
They used to run against the live registry, because it held WVR-007 for
GHSA-jmr9-qjv8-65gv in extract-zip. That waiver is retired: the override on
`@puppeteer/browsers` took extract-zip out of the dependency graph, so there is
nothing left to waive. Had these tests stayed coupled to the live registry they
would have had to be deleted along with it, and the mechanism would have gone
untested from the moment the repository got clean until the moment the next
advisory landed. `test_the_committed_registry_waives_nothing_today` asserts the
clean state separately.

The reports below are recorded `npm audit --json` shapes, so none of this needs
a network call or an installed node_modules tree.
