"""Every workflow's concurrency key must not cost a commit its verdict.

A GitHub concurrency group holds one running run and one *pending* run. A third
run joining the group evicts the pending one, which then ends `cancelled` having
dispatched zero jobs -- no failure, no verdict, and a green-looking checks list
with a hole in it. Keyed only on `github.ref`, every push to the default branch
shares one group with the merge before it, so a burst of merges loses the middle
ones.

Measured twice in this repository. Over the 100 most recent `ci` runs on `main`,
six ended `cancelled` with zero jobs dispatched, which #147 fixed for `ci.yml`.
Then on 2026-09-06, in the same pair of merges, `ci.yml` kept both of its runs
while `portfolio standards` (run 34035866790) and `scorecard` (run 34035866788)
lost theirs to the identical mechanism on commit `abde41c` -- and
`portfolio standards conformance` is a required status check on `main`.

`cancel-in-progress: false` does not protect against this. It governs the
running run; the eviction happens to the pending one. `scorecard.yml` had it set
and was canceled anyway.

So the rule is mechanical: a workflow that declares a concurrency group must key
non-pull-request events on the commit. Exemptions are declared here, with their
reason, rather than achieved by a workflow quietly not being checked.

Parsed with a regular expression rather than a YAML loader on purpose: PyYAML is
not a dependency of this project, only a transitive one, and the other workflow
shape tests in this directory read the files the same way.
