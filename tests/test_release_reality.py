"""A release travels three links, and "cannot tell" is its own answer at each one.

The defect this covers is issue #173, and its shape is worth restating because
the tests below are written against it rather than against the code: the job
that verifies publication was canceled by the same stop that canceled the
publish, so the check and the thing it checks shared a failure mode, and a
`cancelled` run is not a `failure`.

Measured across this portfolio on 2026-09-09: 43 repositories have release or
publish CI, 21 have ever published a release, and 22 have the machinery and
have never once produced one. So the checks here are aimed at the links, not
at the machinery — and each link asserts its own denominator, because a link
that examined nothing reads exactly like a link that held.

Everything here is written as literals. No fixture is derived from
`pyproject.toml`, from the live index, or from the checker's own output: a
fixture computed from the value it checks moves with that value and can never
catch a wrong one.
