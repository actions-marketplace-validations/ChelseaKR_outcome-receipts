"""Tests for the committed eval Markdown rendering.

A narrative with zero numeric spans scores ``grounding_rate`` at 1.0
vacuously (see ``tests/test_evaluate.py::test_evaluate_no_numbers_passes_vacuously``):
no number failed to bind because there was no number to bind. That is a
legitimate reason for the fail-closed gate to pass, but the committed
``eval.md`` must not render that vacuous rate as if it were a measurement --
"Grounding gate (100% required): PASS (observed 100.0%)" reads to a reviewer
as "we scored some numbers and all of them bound," when in fact zero numbers
were scored.
