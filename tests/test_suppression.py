"""Merge-blocking: small-cell suppression must follow the CMS policy.

Suppression is a privacy invariant: aggregate counts below the threshold (1-10,
modeled on the CMS Cell Size Suppression Policy) are redacted from the export.
True zeros are preserved (they contain no privacy risk). Complementary
suppression is applied to prevent recovery of suppressed cells by subtraction.

This test suite is merge-blocking: if suppression fails, the privacy promise
is broken and the export must not proceed.
