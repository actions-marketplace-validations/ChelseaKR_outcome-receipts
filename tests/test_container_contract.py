"""Static contract tests for the optional self-hosting container.

CI performs the real build, locked-down smoke test, and Trivy scan. These fast
tests keep the security properties visible in the ordinary Python suite, where a
change cannot quietly turn a digest back into a mutable tag or restore root.
