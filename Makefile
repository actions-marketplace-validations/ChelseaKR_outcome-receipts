# Reproduce the full local toolchain. CI mirrors `make verify` byte for byte.
# `uv lock --check` first, because `uv sync --frozen` cannot fail on drift. The
# comment that used to sit here claimed --frozen made "a lockfile drift a loud
# CI failure"; it does not. --frozen means "install exactly what uv.lock
# records and never re-resolve", and it never compares the lock against
# pyproject.toml. Bump `project.version` and leave uv.lock behind and
# `uv sync --frozen` still exits 0, having installed the previous version --
# which is exactly the drift a release creates, so the one change guaranteed to
# desynchronize the lock was the one change this step could not see. Every
# release since would have verified against a stale editable install. `uv lock
# --check` re-resolves and exits 1 when the lock no longer matches the
# manifest; npm's half of the pair (`npm ci`, not `npm install`) already fails
# closed the same way. The sync below uses `--locked`, which makes the same
# comparison and exits 1 on drift, so the install cannot pass on a stale lock
# even when it is run on its own without `uv lock --check` ahead of it.

# Every committed example manifest, validated against the published receipts
# schema by a real Draft 2020-12 validator. `receipts verify` re-derives figures
# and never reads the schema, so the manifest dogfood-action verifies stayed at
# schema 1.0 after 2.0 shipped and published three withheld figures as zeros
# under green runs (#198). docs/decisions/0005 keeps jsonschema out of the project
# environment, so it runs isolated at a pinned version, as Semgrep and zizmor
# do, and uv.lock is untouched. Its own gate rather than a line of `hygiene`,
# for the reason `release-version` below gives.

# Its own gate rather than a fourth line of `hygiene`, for the reason the
# comment above SECURITY_GATES gives: make stops a recipe at its first failing
# line, so a source-hygiene failure would take this one with it and the release
# path would silently go unchecked on exactly the commits that are already red.
# release.yml runs it a second time with --tag, which is the comparison only a
# release can make.
release-version:

# The artifact-level counterpart to `release-version`. That one compares numbers
# inside the tree; this one builds the wheel and the sdist and reads the metadata
# PyPI would actually be handed. `python3` rather than `.venv/bin/python` on

# artifacts it is about to upload, and that job has no project environment.

# Each scanner is its own target. They used to be six lines of one recipe, and
# make stops a recipe at the first failing line: an unfixable HIGH advisory in
# the npm accessibility toolchain meant `npm audit` failed on line 2 and
# OSV-Scanner, gitleaks, Semgrep and zizmor never ran at all -- while the CI
# job called "security (pip-audit - osv-scanner - gitleaks - zizmor)" reported
# red, which is exactly what it would have reported if they had.
security-pip:
	.venv/bin/pip-audit --local

# npm cannot accept one reviewed advisory: `--audit-level` is its only lever
# and raising it hides every finding at that severity. The floor stays at HIGH
# and scripts/check_npm_audit.py adjudicates against waivers.yml instead, so
# anything without a live, exact waiver still fails. The registry holds no
# npm-audit waiver right now -- WVR-007 was retired when the override on
# @puppeteer/browsers took extract-zip out of the graph -- and the gate's
# boundary stays under test against a fixture registry regardless.
