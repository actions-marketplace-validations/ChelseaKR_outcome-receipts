# Accessibility Conformance Report

Product: outcome-receipts generated trace view. Evaluation target: WCAG 2.2 AA
and the web-content clauses of EN 301 549 v3.2.1. VPAT-style status terms are
Supports, Partially Supports, Does Not Support, and Not Applicable.

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Text alternatives and non-text content | Supports | Charts carry SVG title/description and an equivalent data table; trace is text. |
| Info and relationships | Partially Supports | Semantic headings, scoped headers, caption, and definition lists are auto-gated; NVDA/VoiceOver table review is pending. |
| Contrast and use of color | Supports | Dark text on white and axe color-contrast gate; meaning does not rely on color. |
| Keyboard and focus | Supports | Native links only; no custom controls, traps, overlays, or sticky content. |
| Reflow and text resize | Supports | Browser gate asserts no horizontal overflow at 320 CSS px; content is linear. |
| Page titled and language identified | Supports | Localized title and valid `html lang` for EN/ES. |
| Name, role, value and status messages | Not Applicable | No forms, custom widgets, live regions, or stateful controls. |

## WCAG 2.2 additions

| Success criterion | Status | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured | Supports | No author-created overlay or fixed content. |
| 2.5.7 Dragging Movements | Not Applicable | No drag interaction. |
| 2.5.8 Target Size | Supports | Links are inline-text exceptions; no pointer-only controls. |
| 3.2.6 Consistent Help | Not Applicable | Single offline page with no help mechanism. |
| 3.3.7 Redundant Entry | Not Applicable | No data entry. |
| 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication | Not Applicable | No authentication. |

## Word export

`run --format docx` writes a Word document this report does not evaluate. It is
built for assistive technology -- heading styles carrying outline levels, a
header row marked to repeat on every page of a table, bulleted lists as real
list paragraphs, the document language and title set, and every chart given as
its data table rather than an image -- but no screen reader, Word accessibility
checker, or person has been through it. Treat it as unevaluated.

## Known gap

Manual VoiceOver and NVDA task walkthroughs are tracked in
[issues 59](https://github.com/ChelseaKR/outcome-receipts/issues/59) and
[60](https://github.com/ChelseaKR/outcome-receipts/issues/60) and are not
complete. Until both rows in
the dated walkthrough are signed, this ACR reports Partially Supports and must not
be represented as a completed human WCAG conformance assessment.
