# Releasing Outcome Receipts

Releases are a manual promotion of an already-reviewed commit on `main`. The
workflow never treats a tag push as authority to publish.

## Trust model

`.github/workflows/release.yml` splits release authority across six jobs so
that no single write-capable step both executes repository code and holds
publication credentials:

1. **`authorize`** calls the standards-owned reusable workflow
   `ChelseaKR/.github/.github/workflows/release-authorize.yml`, pinned to a
   full 40-character commit SHA. It validates a stable SemVer tag, verifies
   an SSH signature against the committed `.github/allowed_signers`, proves
   the tagged commit is reachable from current `origin/main`, and returns
   immutable identifiers (the authorized commit and the tag object SHA).
2. **`verify`** and **`build`** run with `contents: read` at the exact commit
   `authorize` returned. `verify` reruns `make verify` and the cards check;
   `build` produces the wheel/sdist, Sigstore build-provenance and SBOM
   attestations, and the CHANGELOG-derived release notes.
3. **`github-release`** is the only job with `contents: write`. It never
   checks out or executes repository code — it downloads the artifacts
   `build` uploaded, re-compares the live tag object SHA against
   `authorize`'s output, and publishes the GitHub release.
4. **`pypi-publish`** downloads only the attested `dist/` artifacts,
   re-verifies their digests against the manifest `build` recorded, repeats
   the tag-object recheck, and publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing (OIDC,
   no long-lived token).
5. **`verify-published`** confirms the published wheel's Sigstore attestation
   and smoke-tests the package pulled fresh from PyPI.

This separation means a job that can rebuild or execute repository source
never holds `contents: write`, and a job that holds `contents: write` never
rebuilds or executes repository source. `tests/test_release_workflow.py`
pins the shape described above so a future restructuring cannot regress it
silently — see ADR
[0005](adr/0005-adopt-shared-release-authorization.md) for the fuller
rationale and history.

## Prepare a release

1. Update **every place that carries the version**, in one pull request. This
   list is exhaustive as of `0.2.2`, and it is written out because a shorter
   version of this step is what produced the `0.2.1` drift: the promotion to
   `0.2.1` moved `CHANGELOG.md` alone, and `pyproject.toml` sat at `0.2.0`
   through a green `make verify`, a green `ci`, and a `release.yml` whose only
   version check was satisfied by that tree.

   | File | What moves |
   |---|---|
   | `CHANGELOG.md` | `## [Unreleased]` becomes `## [X.Y.Z] - <date>`, and a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` opens above it |
   | `CHANGELOG.md` link definitions | the last lines of the file: `[Unreleased]` re-points at `vX.Y.Z...HEAD`, and a new `[X.Y.Z]` compare line is added. Nothing checks these, and `0.2.1`'s promotion had to come back for them |
   | `pyproject.toml` | `project.version` — this is what `uv build` stamps on the wheel |
   | `uv.lock` | the `outcome-receipts` editable-root entry's `version`; `make install` runs `uv lock --check`, which fails closed on the drift a bump creates |
   | `CITATION.cff` | `version` **and** `date-released` |
   | `README.md` | the status note, and its `Last verified:` stamp |
   | `docs/cards/` | regenerate: `uv run receipts cards --out docs/cards` |

   Three of those seven are now checked against each other by
   `make release-version` (`CHANGELOG.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `CITATION.cff`),
   and `uv.lock` is caught by the `uv lock --check` that `make install` runs.
   The README prose, the CHANGELOG's link definitions and the cards are not
   machine-checked and are still read by a person. The date matters and no gate
   can see it: `make release-version` requires `CITATION.cff`'s `date-released`
   to equal the CHANGELOG section's date, but both are checked for shape, not
   for truth, so a release prepared on one day and tagged on another passes
   green while claiming the wrong date. If the tag is not cut the day the
   promotion is written, move both.

   **After** the release is published, `action.yml`'s `version` input default
   and the places `docs/ci-action.md` restates it move to the new tag —
   separately, because that default names the newest tag a downstream consumer
   can install, which is not true until the release exists.
   `scripts/check_conformance.py` already fails when the action's default and
   the documentation disagree, so they move together or not at all.
2. Merge only after the complete `make verify` gate passes.
3. On current `main`, create an SSH-signed annotated tag:

   ```sh
   git switch main
   git pull --ff-only
   git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "outcome-receipts vX.Y.Z"
   git verify-tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. In GitHub Actions, run the `release` workflow from `main` and supply the
   existing tag:

   ```sh
   gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f tag=vX.Y.Z
   ```

   Do not select a feature branch — `workflow_dispatch` on `main` is the only
   trigger; pushing the tag alone starts nothing.
5. Confirm the GitHub release, attestation bundle, CycloneDX SBOM, and PyPI
   files all correspond to the same version and artifact digests.

The PyPI project must have a Trusted Publisher bound to repository
`ChelseaKR/outcome-receipts`, workflow `release.yml`, and environment `pypi`.
No long-lived PyPI token belongs in repository secrets.

## Failure and recovery

A failed run is safe to rerun with the same unchanged tag. Never move or
reuse a published tag. If verification fails, correct the source and version
in a new pull request and create a new version tag. If publication partially
succeeds, rerun only after confirming the tag object is unchanged; the
workflow replaces GitHub release assets with the same verified bytes, and
PyPI rejects an already-published filename outright.

## The check that would have caught `v0.2.0`

Step 5 above — confirm the GitHub release, the attestations, the SBOM and the
PyPI files all correspond — is a person's step, and on 2026-08-16 it was not
taken. Nothing in the repository noticed for nine days, because the job that
would have noticed (`verify-published`) was canceled by the same stop that
canceled the publish it was there to verify.

`.github/workflows/release-reality.yml` asks weekly, from outside the release
run, and follows a release through **three links** rather than one:

| link | what it reads | how a release stops here |
|---|---|---|
| a dated changelog section has a tag | `CHANGELOG.md`, `GET /repos/…/tags` | the section was promoted and the tag was never cut, so a pin written against the version resolves to nothing |
| a stable tag has a published release | `GET /repos/…/tags`, `GET /repos/…/releases` | the tag was pushed and the dispatch in step 4 never ran — pushing a tag alone starts nothing |
| a published release is on the index | `GET /repos/…/releases`, `https://pypi.org/simple/outcome-receipts/` | the dispatch ran and `pypi-publish` was never approved: **this is `v0.2.0`** |

It needs nothing from the run that published, so it cannot share that run's
failure mode. `scripts/check_release_reality.py` decides, prints both numbers
for every link, and has three answers rather than two — a document it could
not read is **unmeasurable** and exits 2, which is neither a pass nor a
finding.

Two things it deliberately does not do. It does not read a release's
**assets**: a release with none is not a failed release, two repositories in
this portfolio publish source-only releases on purpose, and what is being
followed is the version. And it does not read
`https://pypi.org/project/<name>/`, which answers an automated caller with
HTTP 200 and a bot-detection page; the simple API returns 404 for a
distribution that is absent, which is an answer.

It will stay red until every link holds. That is the state it exists to
report, not a defect in the commit it runs against.
