# Responsible-Tech Audits — outcome-receipts

Project-specific findings under the portfolio Responsible-Tech Framework. This
artifact is reviewed on release; generic thresholds remain in portfolio-standards.

## Applicability

- A Ethics: applies.
- B Bias: applies because metric definitions and denominators shape claims.
- C Privacy/DPIA: applies; client-level L3 data is processed ephemerally and L2
  aggregates are published.
- D Transparency: applies; figures, model boundary, cards, and eval are disclosed.
- E Accessibility: applies to generated trace HTML and chart SVG.
- F Security: applies; ASVS authentication level is N/A because the offline CLI
  has no auth, authorization, or network ingress. SAST, SCA, secret scanning, and
  supply-chain controls still apply.
- AI Evaluation: applies to the optional Bedrock drafting seam; RAG retrieval
  metrics are N/A because there is no retriever, corpus, or vector store.
- Internationalization: applies to public report and trace output in EN/ES.

## A. Ethics

The primary harm is a wrong or invented number reaching a funder, with funding
and credibility consequences for the organization and indirect effects on the
people it serves. The control is structural: SQL computes figures, immutable
receipts record derivation, both pre- and post-suppression narratives pass the
numeric-span gate, and a named person approves the final redacted artifact.

Review gate: changing the numeric origin, approval order, or export boundary
requires an ADR and explicit trust/privacy review in the pull request.

## B. Bias and fairness

A correct query can encode an unfair definition. Receipts therefore carry a
plain-language definition, denominator, unit, category assumptions, data source,
collection frequency, and caveat when provided. Mapping candidates never approve
themselves; ambiguity and missing columns enter a human review queue.

Known limits remain: receipts do not prove collection completeness, consent,
measurement validity, causal impact, or that a category scheme treats groups
fairly. EN/ES benchmark parity proves the same numeric grounding enforcement in
both languages, not cultural or narrative-quality parity.

## C. Privacy and data-protection impact assessment

### Data flow and classification

Organization CSV rows are L3 while held in process. The loader validates them and
creates an in-memory SQLite table. Compute emits scalar figures with exact query,
row count, column names, BLAKE2b slice hash, value, and timestamp. Drafting,
grounding, suppression, rendering, bundles, and ledgers operate on figures and
provenance, not source rows. Published reports and manifests are L2 aggregates.

The optional Bedrock request is the sole cloud boundary. It receives the filled
narrative and scalar display allowlist only, with no rows, identifiers, SQL,
hashes, or paths. It is disabled unless the config policy and per-run CLI flag
both opt in. Small aggregate displays can reach the provider before publication
suppression, so the adopting organization must authorize the transfer and review
its Bedrock logging and retention configuration.

`receipts mcp` adds a second surface where a model meets this tool, and it is
not a cloud boundary: the transport is standard input and output on the
operator's own machine, the server opens no socket, and every response is
computed from the post-suppression figure set. What crosses it is whatever the
assistant already holds — the operator's own draft, sent in, and a bound/unbound
verdict sent back. A withheld cell is answerable only as the redaction marker
with null numerics; the pre-suppression figures are consulted in one place, to
*classify* a span as a disclosure, and no display or value from that set enters
a response. Tool arguments carry the draft, so nothing narrative is logged: the
error path names the method and the exception class only. The server exposes no
tool that writes, exports, or records an approval, so it cannot stand in for the
named human sign-off `run` requires.

### Minimization, suppression, retention, and recovery

The application does not copy or persist source rows. Counts 1 through 10 are
redacted under the CMS-modeled default; complementary, delta, and percentage
controls block direct arithmetic recovery, while true zero remains distinct.
HUD does not prescribe that numeric floor, so the report's controlling local or
funder policy remains the operator's decision.

Reports, receipts, bundles, and the export ledger contain aggregates and
provenance. They remain under operator retention. The application has no durable
client database; backup and restore are documented as copying the report inputs,
outputs, key, and ledger together, then running all verify commands before trust.

Data cards: `docs/data/organization-service-export.md`,
`docs/data/synthetic-fixtures.md`, and `docs/cards/data-card-reporting.md`.

## D. Transparency and explainability

Every figure carries the query, row count, slice hash, timestamp, unit, and
definition. The report and accessible trace render that evidence; manifests and
bundle hashes support machine verification. `receipts verify`, bundle verification,
and ledger verification fail closed on drift.

The generated model and data cards describe the Bedrock boundary, limitations,
out-of-scope uses, and bilingual gate evidence. The committed eval reports Wilson
confidence intervals, and the 136-case benchmark includes planted EN/ES failures.
No model judge ships, so judge calibration is explicitly N/A until one is added.

## E. Accessibility

The generated trace and charts target WCAG 2.2 AA. `make a11y` builds a real trace
and runs axe, pa11y, Lighthouse accessibility ≥0.90, 320px reflow, and reduced
motion checks. Charts have an SVG title and description plus equivalent data
tables. EN/ES pages set the document language.

Review artifacts: `docs/a11y/ACR.md`, `docs/a11y/STATEMENT.md`, and the dated
screen-reader walkthrough. The required macOS VoiceOver and Windows NVDA task
walkthroughs remain unexecuted; they are recorded as a release review blocker and
are not inferred from automated results.

## F. Security and supply chain

- ASVS: N/A for auth/authz/ingress because the product is an offline CLI. Input
  validation, SQL trust boundaries, output encoding, and all supply-chain controls
  still apply.
- Container scanning: the optional self-host image pins its Python and uv bases
  by digest, installs from `uv.lock`, runs as a numeric non-root user, and is
  smoke-tested with no network, no capabilities, and a read-only root. CI fails
  on HIGH or CRITICAL OS/library findings from Trivy.
- SBOM/signing: CycloneDX 1.7 SBOM plus GitHub Sigstore-backed build and SBOM
  attestations on every signed-tag release; PyPI uses OIDC Trusted Publishing.
- Secret policy: credentials stay in environment/provider stores, never config;
  rotate and revoke first on exposure, then assess history and notification using
  `docs/OPERATIONS.md`. Review annually.
- SAST/SCA/secrets: Ruff security rules, Semgrep, CodeQL, pip-audit, OSV-Scanner,
  npm audit, gitleaks, zizmor, and OpenSSF Scorecard are blocking on their declared
  triggers. Dynamic SQL waivers are narrow, quoted/trusted, and tracked in issue
  52 plus `.semgrep-waivers.yml`. The Python 3.7 compatibility false positive
  remains tracked in issue 53. The 2026-07-22 waiver review confirmed that
  identifiers remain quoted, SQL values remain parameterized, mapping candidates
  remain unexecuted, and a no-suppression Semgrep 1.168.0 scan still reports the
  obsolete Python 3.7 rule against this Python 3.12-only package. The 2026-08-28
  review repeated both no-suppression scans: each rule still fires, so neither
  waiver can be retired. `make hygiene` now also runs
  `scripts/check_semgrep_waivers.py`, which compares `.semgrep-waivers.yml`
  against `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/` and `.github/` in both directions, so
  within those four directories a ledger row cannot outlive the suppression it
  documents and an undocumented suppression cannot be added. Before it, both of
  those states passed every gate. The scan is those four directories and the
  suffixes `.py`, `.mjs`, `.js`, `.sh`, `.yml`, `.yaml` and `.toml`, which is
  narrower than `make security-semgrep`, which scans the whole repository: a
  suppression added under `eval/`, `docs/`, `examples/` or at the repository
  root is not seen by this check, and that gap is why the sentence names its
  scope rather than claiming the tree. That check also holds the quarterly
  cadence issues 52 and 53 commit to: a `last_reviewed` date more than 92 days
  old fails the build naming its tracking issue, a date in the future is
  refused, and a review date recorded here but not in the ledger — or in the
  ledger but not here — is reported as the two records disagreeing. Until then
  `last_reviewed` was parsed and discarded, so a waiver whose review had lapsed
  by a year passed exactly like one reviewed yesterday, and this paragraph and
  the ledger could describe two different reviews with nothing to notice. On the
  2026-08-28 dates above, the next review is due **2026-11-28**.
- VEX: N/A today because scans report no unfixable HIGH/CRITICAL dependency CVE.
  Any future exception requires a CycloneDX VEX and quarterly review.

Threat and governance artifacts: `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`, the AI risk register,
impact assessment, ISO 42001 applicability map, red-team report, and residual-risk
register under `docs/audits/`.
