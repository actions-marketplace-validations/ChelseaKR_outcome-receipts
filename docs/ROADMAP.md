# Roadmap

*Last verified: 2026-07-22 · Recheck cadence: quarterly*

Planned direction for outcome-receipts. Dates are intentions, not promises;
items move earlier when users ask for them. Feedback is welcome as GitHub issues.

The sequencing rule: ship the differentiator first with the least-risky
subsystems, then grow outward. The differentiator is the receipt plus the
fail-closed grounding gate. The risky parts (an LLM in the drafting path, metric
mapping over messy real exports) come after the trust machinery has proven out.

## Architecture

A deterministic state machine: compute figures with receipts, draft and ground
against the raw receipted values, suppress every publishable surface, ground the
redacted result again, let a human approve, export.

```
compute -> draft -> ground -> suppress -> re-draft/re-ground -> approve -> export
(SQL +     (figures   (raw       (privacy     (publishable      (human     (bundle +
 receipt)   only)      gate)       gate)         gate)            sign-off)  manifest)
```

## v0.1.0 — Receipts, no LLM (released 2026-07-11)

* Service-data CSV in, a TOML metric spec, the deterministic SQLite engine,
  receipts, the deterministic template drafter, and the grounding gate.
* Committed eval (`eval/report.md`) on seeded synthetic fixtures; the gate is a
  merge-blocking test.
* Definition of done: a messy figure set resolves to a receipted report, every
  number in the narrative binds to a receipt, and an injected unverifiable number
  is caught. Met.

### Expansions

* **EXP-02 author-declared data checks (pre-compute quality gate) — done.**
  Spec authors declare `[[data_checks]]` data-quality assertions (each an
  `assert_sql` returning a single scalar) that run before any figure is computed
  and fail closed: a violated precondition raises before a receipt is produced and
  blocks the whole run/export, extending the "fail closed everywhere" invariant to
  the data the figures rest on.

## v0.2.0 — Small-cell suppression (completed)

* ✅ The privacy invariant: aggregate counts below a threshold suppressed, with
  complementary suppression and true zeros preserved, modeled on the U.S. CMS
  Cell Size Suppression Policy. CMS—not HUD—supplies the numeric default; HUD's
  HMIS publication guide leaves the numeric rule to the applicable local policy.
  Implementation: threshold = 11 (CMS policy: suppress 1–10), complementary
  suppression applied to totals, true zeros (0) preserved. Tested with
  comprehensive cases covering threshold behavior, complementary suppression, and
  aggregate-only export. Merge-blocking: `tests/test_suppression.py`.
* ✅ Calibration against real, non-synthetic data (issue 94, 2026-08-21):
  ran the shipped engine over HUD's own 2024 CoC Point-in-Time subpopulation
  counts (363 CoCs, 10,890 real cells). No HUD-published numeric small-cell
  rule exists to match — confirming the gap this section already named — but
  applied to subpopulation-shaped data, threshold 11 withholds a majority of
  granular cells (60.7%, vs. ~1% for whole-CoC totals) and complementary
  suppression fires on 95% of CoCs, evidence the default does real,
  differentiated privacy work in this domain rather than being an
  unvalidated placeholder. Full findings:
  [`docs/audits/hud-coc-suppression-calibration-2026-08-21.md`](audits/hud-coc-suppression-calibration-2026-08-21.md);
  recomputed and gated by `tests/test_hud_suppression_calibration.py`.
* ✅ Aggregate-only export mode for figures shared externally. Provenance
  attestation includes `aggregate_only: true`; the artifact boundary accepts
  only scalar `Figure` objects and never receives the source client rows.

## v0.3.0 — The drafting seam

* ✅ An optional Claude-on-Bedrock drafter that writes the narrative prose around the
  receipted figures, guarded by the same grounding gate. Off by default and
  policy-gated by config plus `--allow-cloud-drafting`, so the deterministic
  drafter remains the zero-dependency default. The manifest records which
  narrative drafter was used; both raw and publishable drafts must pass the gate.
* If an LLM judge scores narrative faithfulness, calibrate against human labels
  with Cohen's kappa and fail closed on drift.
* ✅ Generated [model](cards/model-card.md) and [data](cards/data-card-reporting.md) cards describe the
  provider boundary, limitations, evaluation, privacy, and retention. Tagged
  release verification fails if committed cards drift from the generator.

## v0.4.0 — The metric-mapping agent

* ✅ Map a funder template's required metrics to deterministic queries over a
  schema-variant export (HMIS CSV and common funder shapes), with a review queue
  for mappings. `receipts map` recognizes canonical fields and documented HMIS
  aliases, emits candidate `MetricSpec` queries, blocks missing/ambiguous fields,
  and marks every candidate `pending`/`review_required`; it never executes or
  approves a guess. See [metric-mapping.md](metric-mapping.md).

## v0.5.0 — Provenance manifest and verify (completed)

* ✅ Each exported report carries a manifest of its receipts and slice hashes;
  `receipts verify` re-checks that the figures still compute from the cited data.
* **EXP-11 — Hash-chained export ledger (shipped).** `run` appends every
  successful export to an append-only, hash-chained ledger (report title, a
  BLAKE2b hash of the receipts manifest, recipient, timestamp), each entry linked
  to the prior by hash so tampering is detectable. `receipts verify-ledger`
  re-hashes the chain and fails closed on any break. The record of what was
  reported to whom is itself receipted. See ADR 0004.
* ✅ **Shipped:** `receipts verify` is packaged as a reusable composite GitHub Action
  (`action.yml`), so a downstream repo can gate CI on receipt drift with
  `uses: ChelseaKR/outcome-receipts@v1`. See [ci-action.md](ci-action.md).

## v1.0.0 — Implementation package complete; release evidence pending

The repository-side work is complete:

* ✅ Multi-funder output renders one receipted figure set into two distinct
  maintained funder templates under `examples/multi-funder/`.
* ✅ `make container-demo` provides one-command Docker self-hosting. The
  digest-pinned, non-root image is smoke-tested without network access and
  scanned by Trivy for HIGH/CRITICAL findings in CI.
* ✅ All six responsible-tech audits and the AI, privacy, accessibility,
  security, data-governance, and residual-risk evidence are committed.
* ✅ The report spec and receipts manifest publish `1.0` JSON Schemas and a
  SemVer compatibility policy. Unsupported declared versions fail before
  compute or verification.
* ✅ Six bounded evidence workflows cover restatements, migration equivalence,
  funder requirement changes, contract milestones, verified partner rollups,
  and suppression-aware equity review. Receipt-composed values are visibly
  distinct from row-backed receipts.
* ✅ `receipts verify-workflow` fail-closes on unsupported artifact versions,
  malformed relationships and digests, client-level fields, or broken composed
  lineage. Generated version-1.0 fixtures freeze every workflow kind for future
  release-to-release checks.

A `v1.0.0` tag remains evidence-gated, not code-gated. It requires use against
more than one real organization
([#64](https://github.com/ChelseaKR/outcome-receipts/issues/64)), compatible
schema evidence across two consecutive tagged releases
([#65](https://github.com/ChelseaKR/outcome-receipts/issues/65)), and the
recorded VoiceOver/macOS and NVDA/Windows task reviews
([#59](https://github.com/ChelseaKR/outcome-receipts/issues/59) and
[#60](https://github.com/ChelseaKR/outcome-receipts/issues/60)). Those
observations cannot be manufactured in this repository. There are no remaining
implementation items in the authoritative roadmap.

The implemented designs and real-world validation gates are recorded in
[`NOVEL-USE-CASES.md`](NOVEL-USE-CASES.md).

## Eval and quality plan

* The gated metric is the **grounding rate**: the share of numbers in the
  narrative that bind to a receipt, fail-closed at 100%. The hallucinated-number
  rate is reported with Wilson confidence intervals.
* Fixtures are seeded synthetic with planted ground-truth figures and a planted
  unverifiable number; zero real personal data.
* **FIX-11 — property-based and mutation testing on the invariant core (done).**
  The grounding gate is covered by Hypothesis property tests
  (`tests/test_grounding_properties.py`): over adversarial narratives that mix
  receipted figure displays with randomly injected numbers, every ungrounded
  number lands in `unbound`, `ok` is true iff `unbound` is empty, redaction is
  total, and grounding is idempotent after redaction. Mutation testing (mutmut,
  `make mutation`) is scoped to `grounding.py` and `engine.py`; the property
  tests kill every mutant in the grounding gate itself.

### DORA and quality-debt baseline

Portfolio collection on 2026-07-11, over a 90-day window, and observe-only: none
of these is a release gate. They are recorded as rows rather than prose so each
one carries its own graduation date, which the measurement standard requires. A
metric may not sit in BASELINE indefinitely: on the date named, each either
becomes an AUTO or REVIEW gate or is retired, and the decision is recorded here.

| Metric | Measured 2026-07-11 | Gate |
|--------|---------------------|------|
| Deployment frequency | 2.1 deploy/merge proxies per week; 27 merges; 3.19 PRs per week | BASELINE until 2026-10-11 |
| Change lead time | 149.8 hours median | BASELINE until 2026-10-11 |
| Change-fail rate | 0.0, revert-based proxy | BASELINE until 2026-10-11 |
| Revert rate | zero reverts | BASELINE until 2026-10-11 |
| Churn ratio | 0.074 | BASELINE until 2026-10-11 |
| Short-term churn (14 days) | 69% | BASELINE until 2026-10-11 |
| Unreviewed-merge rate | 100% | BASELINE until 2026-10-11 |

The unreviewed-merge value is the one that matters most here. It is a risk signal
for a solo-maintained, agent-assisted repository, and it is what the required
pull-request acknowledgment and the complete automated gate set exist to answer.
Its graduation decision is not a mechanical one: ADR 0002 holds the ruleset's
required approving reviews at zero for as long as there is one maintainer, so
gating on this metric and that ADR cannot both stand. Whichever way it goes on
2026-10-11 needs a recorded decision, and if the metric graduates, a superseding
ADR.

Two artifacts the measurement standard asks for are not here and are not claimed:
the weekly portfolio metrics rollup, which is produced at the portfolio level
rather than in this repository, and the quarterly seven-capability
self-assessment, which is the maintainer answering about her own practice and
cannot be written for her.

## Out of scope

* Becoming a data warehouse or BI tool. It computes the figures a report needs
  and proves them.
* Inventing a verification primitive. The verify-or-flag idea is published; the
  contribution is the open offline chain, the metric mapping, and the privacy
  posture.
