# Keep the enforced pull-request approval count at zero for one maintainer

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-12
- Deciders: Chelsea Kelly-Reif

## Context

The portfolio standard calls for an approving review on main. This repository has
one active maintainer, and GitHub does not count an author's approval of their own
pull request. Setting the ruleset count to one would make every maintainer-authored
change unmergeable rather than create an independent review.

## Decision

The ruleset requires a pull request, resolved review threads, signed linear
history, an up-to-date branch, and every applicable automated check, but records
`required_approving_review_count: 0` and no code-owner approval. The maintainer
records the self-review with the pull-request Definition of Done checklist.

When a second active maintainer is available, a new ADR must supersede this one
and raise the live and committed review count to one before that maintainer's
changes are relied on as an independent review.

## Consequences

Direct pushes are structurally blocked and review evidence is explicit, but the
independence objective remains unmet for maintainer-authored work. The portfolio
unreviewed-merge metric remains an honest risk signal rather than being disguised
as an approval that GitHub cannot enforce.

**Note, 2026-08-28.** "Direct pushes are structurally blocked" holds for every
actor but one. The live ruleset's `bypass_actors` carries the repository owner's
standing bypass (`RepositoryRole` 5, `bypass_mode: always`), deliberately and
permanently: an agent once applied a ruleset with no bypass and locked the owner
out of their own repository, and restoring access took a sweep across eighteen
repositories. This decision is unchanged by that. The approval count stays at
zero, the bypass is the way back in when a required check is wedged rather than a
routine merge path, and it is the only actor permitted to skip these rules --
`tests/test_ruleset_lockout.py` fails the build if a second one appears in a
committed ruleset file, or if the owner's own goes missing from one. See
`docs/rulesets/README.md`.
